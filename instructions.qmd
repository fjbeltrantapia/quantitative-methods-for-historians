Below are the instructions to prepare the session in advance: 

**1. Install R and RStudio**. **R** is a (free) statistical software and **RStudio** is an integrated interface that makes working with R easier. Bear in mind that you have to download and install both softwares: R and RStudio. The version you install depends on whether you are using Windows or Mac. Here is a [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to access them.

**2. Create a dedicated folder to this session in your computer.** Name it `quants`. 

**3. Download the following materials**. Store these files in separate folders (named `data` and `scripts`, respectively) within the folder `quants`:

  * The [datasets]{.underline} we will be working with: [here](data/paisley-data.xlsx) and <a href="data/state-of-the-union-texts.csv" download>here</a>.
    
  * The [R scripts]{.underline} containing the code to extract information from them (available in Blackboard).
  
**4. Get familiar with R and RStudio** by opening **RStudio** and following the instructions in the [Intro to R](get-r.html) section.  
  
**5. Read the following texts in advance:** 

  - The background information for the two [case-studies]{.underline} we will be exploring: [The Paisley Prisoners' Dataset](backg-paisley.html) and [The State of the Union Presidential Speeches](backg-speeches.html).

  - The article [Quantifying history]{.underline} (available in Blackboard). This text outlines the advantages and disadvantages of using quantitative and computational methods in history. We will be discussing it at the beginning of the first session.

**6. Do not forget to bring your laptop!**
